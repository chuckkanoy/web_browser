#Web Browser
This is another project from my CSCI 459: Foundations of Computer Networks class. It  only has one source code file which compiles into one executable file. It reads raw html data from a website.

## Compiling:
```
gcc web_browser.c -o web_browser.exe
```

## Usage:
```
./web_browser.exe host_name file_path port_number
```	
EXAMPLE:
```
./web_browser.exe www.google.com ./index.html 80
```
